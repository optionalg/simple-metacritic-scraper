CS Class Project

xx This is a hub for data and scripts for CS 5010's final project

To Do:
1. Add module to scrape start at base url: http://www.metacritic.com/browse/movies/score/metascore/all/filtered?sort=desc
2. Pull list of movie URL's fashioned like "/movie/<moviename>"
3. Cycle through the base url's 94 possible pages using ?page=<currentpage> option
4. Once that list of movie urls is collected:

5. Plug into existing modules to extract
6. Add module to write to PIPE DELIMITED TEXT FILE (never use CSV in the real world)
7. Add script to import and analyze the data and add some visualization
8. Ideas?


BRADY:
Genre and PG-Rating for Each Movie

# Movies over Time
Scores by Genre
Score by Rating
Highest year in terms of dating
Genres by Year
Violin Plot of Rating Distribution by Genre
top 5 movies per year (what are their best )

Scatter plot of user ratings by critic rating // color by bucketed genre (limit to movies that have enough people)


Removals: 
-- Remove movies that have "too few" ratings by critics and people

User Interaction:
1) Choose your birthdate and favourite genre and it will reccomed a movie closest to that day in that genre
