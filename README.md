CS Class Project

xx This is a hub for data and scripts for CS 5010's final project

To Do:
1. Add module to scrape start at base url: http://www.metacritic.com/browse/movies/score/metascore/all/filtered?sort=desc
2. Pull list of movie URL's fashioned like "/movie/<moviename>"
3. Cycle through the base url's 94 possible pages using ?page=<currentpage> option
4. Once that list of movie urls is collected:

5. Plug into existing modules to extract
6. Add module to write to PIPE DELIMITED TEXT FILE (never use CSV in the real world)
7. Add script to import and analyze the data and add some visualization
8. Ideas?
